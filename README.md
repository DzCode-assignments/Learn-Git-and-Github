<b>This repository is an assignments repo, it means you will use it for solving and answering the questions and the exercises given by [@SofianeHamlaoui](https://github.com/SofianeHamlaoui) </b>

# How does this work 

After submiting to the course, you can now have this repository and do chages to it.
If you are here it means you have already done and understood lesson [0x0](https://dzcode-io.github.io/Learn-Git-and-Github/lessons/0x0-HelloWorld/HelloWorld) and lesson [1x0](https://dzcode-io.github.io/Learn-Git-and-Github/lessons/0x1-CreateAnIssue/CreateAnIssue)

## How to use issues to apply your assignements

if you followed well the lesson 0x1 you would understand how to handle that, But you will need some modifications here :

While making an Issue, you have to set :
-   <b>The Title</b> : Every title should be the name of the assignment, so for example in the case of [1x0](https://dzcode-io.github.io/Learn-Git-and-Github/lessons/0x1-CreateAnIssue/CreateAnIssue)'s Assignement, it is "Lesson 0x1 Assignment".
-   <b>The Body</b> : use it to write a response and/or upload a screenshot.
